# TrafficBayesianDDQN

## Objective

This project aims to the development of a DDQN (Double Deep Q Network) using a Baeysian Neural Network in order to prevent 
possible attacks to the Neural Network due to som kind of disturb made on the images.

The imput for the Neural Network is a aereal view of the simulation.
