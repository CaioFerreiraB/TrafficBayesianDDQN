# TrafficBayesianDDQN

## Objective

This project aims to the development of a DDQN (Double Deep Q Network) using a Baeysian Neural Network in order to prevent 
possible attacks to the Neural Network due to som kind of disturb made on the images.

The imput for the Neural Network is a aereal view of the simulation of a simple network with just two lanes and one junction, without traffic lights. The obective of the simulation is that, given to cars starting one in each lane, both can learn how to cross the junction without a collision.
